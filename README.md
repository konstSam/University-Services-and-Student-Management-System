# University-Services and Student Management System
Services either for a University student or faculty

The project focuses on building a database management system for an educational institution. It provides a structured database schema to store information about students, lessons, professors, assignments, and various administrative aspects. The database design allows for efficient management and retrieval of data related to student enrollment, grades, course offerings, and academic administration.

There is also an app that connects to that database, a student or the faculty can take advantage of, for example a student can find the courses that a university offers, or a secretary employee can find all students that are enrolled in a given course.
